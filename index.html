<p class="double">
     The Lisa Rinna M&M refers to an orange M&M character with American actress Lisa Rinna's face on it that's used in memes without context. The image is from an M&M ad for the 2008 Oscars Awards. Often times, the song "After Like" by IVE plays in the background of video memes. In 2022, the Lisa Rinna M&M became commonplace on Twitter and TikTok. 
    
    ChatGPT states: 
    "As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I'm not aware of any specific information about a Lisa Rinna M&M. It's possible that there may be new developments or products introduced after that date. Lisa Rinna is a well-known American actress, television personality, and businesswoman, and she has been involved in various projects and collaborations.
    
    If there have been new developments or releases related to Lisa Rinna and M&M after my last update, I recommend checking the latest news sources or Lisa Rinna's official social media accounts for the most up-to-date information.. As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I have no information about Lisa Rinna being associated with any specific M&M product that would be considered "god." It's possible that there have been new developments or collaborations since then.

    To get the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend checking recent news sources, Lisa Rinna's official social media accounts, or any official statements from M&M's if there has been a collaboration or new product introduction after my last update. Keep in mind that the information available may change, so it's good to verify with the latest sources." but ChatGPT is wrong because Lisa Rina M&m could be God.
